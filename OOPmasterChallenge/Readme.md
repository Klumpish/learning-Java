"Bill runs a fast-food hamburger restaurant and sells hamburger meals.
his meal order are composed of three items, the hamburger, the drink and
the side item.
your challenge is to write an application to let bill select the type of
burgers and some of the additional items or extras that can be added to the
burgers as well as the actual pricing.

You need a meal order.

- This should be composed of exactly one burger, one drink and one side
  item.
- The most common meal order should be created without any arguments, like
  a regular burger, a small coke, and fries, for example.
  You need a drink and side item.
- the drink should have at least a type,size and price, and the price of
  the drink should change for each size.
- the side item needs at least a type and price.
  You need burgers.
- Every hamburger should have a burger type, a base price, and up to a
  maximum of three extra toppings.
- the constructor should include only the burger type and price.
- extra toppings on a burger need to be added somehow and priced according
  to their type.
  The deluxe burger bonus.
- create a deluxe burger meal with a deluxe burger that has a set price, so
  that any additional toppings do not change the price.
- the deluxe burger should have room for an additional two toppings.
  Your main method should have code to do the following:
- create a default meal that uses the no arguments constructor.
- create a meal with a burger and drink and side item of your choice, with
  up to 3 extra toppings.
- create a meal with a deluxe burger where all items, drink, side item, and
  up to 5 extra toppings are included in the burger price.
  For each meal order, you'll want to perform these functions:
- add some additional toppings to the burger.
- change the size of the drink.
- print the itemized list. this should include the price of the burger, any
  extra toppings, the drink price based on size , and the side item price.
- print the total due amount for the meal"
